Travel Planner App

This project creates an asynchronous web app that uses Web API's and user data to dynamically update the UI.

- Fetches weather forecast for given location at a given time
- Fetches a photo of the choosen location
- Counts down to departure
- Delete button for erasing current trip

You need a personal API key to DarkSky and to Pixabay for this app to work.
